# Climathon
Data repository for the Sydney Climathon of 2019

This repo compiles the multiple open datasets that will help you build a solution for the Sydney Climathon from the 25th to the 26th of October 2019. 
The datasets present here complete the Munich RE GIS datasets that will be available to you on the 25 and 26 of October. Because of the nature of this data, we will not release it this repo. 

Each dataset or source is categorised by impact. Because your main objective is to decrease the impacts of next heatwaves, you want to understand how these impact might vary from suburb to suburb or over time. 
While some datasets might be relevant to several types of impact, we selected what we estimated being the main impact. 

Your objectives for this 24-hours hackathon is to: 
**Better identify the Sydney suburbs and locations with the greatest future exposure to the
adverse impacts of heatwaves** 
and/or 
**Develop innovative data-driven solutions to improve Sydney’s resilience to these adverse
impacts, such as preventative services (e.g. retro-fitting), early detection and warning
systems, severity reduction tools, response optimisation and recovery management
solutions.**	
		
		

**Types of Impact** 

1. Direct Impacts 

    **People** 
    
      A. Health issues: dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke
      
      B. Populations at risks: Elderly, infants, outdoor workers
      
      C. Need for emergencies: emergency services readiness and capacity 
      
    **Infrastructures** 
    
      C. Road surface melting 
      
    **Supplies** 
    
      D. Electricity consumption 
      
      E. Water consumption 
      
    **Fauna and Flora** 
    
      F. 
      
 2. Indirect Impacts 
 
    **Economy** 
    
    A. Productivity decrease 
    
    B. Healthcare costs & insurance premiums increase
    
    **Infrastructures** 
    
    
    
    
    
  **What is the Urban Islan Heat Effect?** 
  "*This is due to factors such as buildings that block
wind, the use of dark-coloured paving or asphalt, heat generated by vehicles, air
conditioners and industrial facilities, and a lack of vegetation to cool parts of a
city. The effects of urban heat islands are often worse in the densest parts of the
city with the fewest greenspaces. This may include central business districts,
informal settlements and other areas with high population density.15 Research
indicates that in cities with wet climates, urban heat island impacts are further
compounded by high humidity in the air leading to a heightened impact on
human health.16 Other factors like higher concentrations of air pollution in urban
areas can also aggravate the human health impact of extreme heat in cities.*"
